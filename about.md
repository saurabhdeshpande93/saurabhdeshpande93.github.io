# About

I am deeply passionate about AI and the way it can transform a wide range of fields. With over five years of experience in AI-driven solutions, my work spans scientific simulations, computer vision, and social sciences, and is enriched by experience in the space, medical, and automation sectors.

More recetly, I was a Computer Vision Engineer on the Perception and AI founding team at Circu Li-ion, a startup focused on sustainable lithium battery upcycling, where I developed AI-based vision solutions to automate robotic disassembly of electric vehicle battery packs.

<!-- Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the Legato Team at the University of Luxembourg, where I also completed my PhD. Under the mentorship of [Prof. Stéphane Bordas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKZBZ48AAAAJ&hl=en), my research focused on developing novel AI techniques for scientific simulations and computer vision challenges. My PhD thesis, titled 'Data Driven Surrogate Frameworks for Computational Mechanics: Bayesian and Geometric Deep Learning Approaches', was completed under Stéphane’s guidance and defended in September 23. This research was supported by the prestigious Marie Skłodawaska Curie Actions fellowship and was part of the [ITN Rainbow](https://rainbow.ku.dk), a European training network. During my PhD, I worked on developing Bayesian and geometric deep learning models to create reliable computing models for computational mechanics applications (refer [<span style="color:blue">Publications</span>](/publications)). My thesis received the Excellent Thesis Award at the University of Luxembourg. -->

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher with the Legato Team at the University of Luxembourg, where I also completed my PhD under the mentorship of [Prof. Stéphane Bordas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKZBZ48AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focused on developing AI techniques for scientific simulations and computer vision, particularly through Bayesian and geometric deep learning models (refer [<span style="color:blue">Publications</span>](/publications)). My PhD thesis, 'Data Driven Surrogate Frameworks for Computational Mechanics: Bayesian and Geometric Deep Learning Approaches', was supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship as part of the [ITN Rainbow](https://rainbow.ku.dk) network and received the Excellent Thesis Award at the University of Luxembourg. 

<!-- I recently started a postdoctoral role with the Legato Team at the University of Luxembourg after completing my PhD there. I collaborate with Prof. [Prof. Stéphane Bordas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKZBZ48AAAAJ&hl=en). I am deeply interested in AI and its applications to scientific domains and more recently I have also been working on deep-learning techniques for medical imaging applications. I defended my PhD thesis titled 'Data Driven Surrogate Frameworks for Computational Mechanics: Bayesian and Geometric Deep Learning Approaches' under Stéphane's supervision in September 23. My PhD research was funded by the prestigious Marie Skłodawaska Curie Actions fellowship and it was a part of [ITN Rainbow](https://rainbow.ku.dk), an European training network. As a part of my Ph.D., I have developed Bayesian and geometric deep learning frameworks to come up with scalable, accurate and trustworthy computing models, for their applications in computational mechanics (refer [<span style="color:blue">Publications</span>](/publications)).

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Team Legato of the University of Luxembourg,
I am being supervised by [Prof. Stéphane Bordas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKZBZ48AAAAJ&hl=en).
My thesis is a part of  Marie Skłodawaska Curie Actions funded European training network, [ITN Rainbow](https://rainbow.ku.dk).

See [<span style="color:blue">this video</span>](https://youtu.be/sj8JUoGhit0) to get an informal introduction to one aspect of my PhD research :) -->


Prior to that, I spent two wonderful years as a Scientist/Engineer 'SC' at the Indian Space Research Organisation ([ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in)).
I graduated with an integrated bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering (specialisation in product design)
from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in 2017. I have also spent a semester at the Technical University of Munich.

Sports has always held a special place in my heart, it has helped me make great friends. During formative years, cricket was my first love (as it is for most Indians). As I grew older, I discovered new games like badminton and chess, playing friendly matches with a neighbor uncle. It was in high school that I developed  a great interest in table tennis, representing my district in state-level tournaments and later also representing my alma mater, IIT Madras, at intercollege sports festivals. At IIT Madras I fell in everlasting love with Squash, I have tried my hands at waterpolo and football too. I still get goosegumops when I think back to those tense Schroeter moments (inter-hostel sports competition, which my hostel won in 2016, where I was a captain of TT and Squash team. Go Godav!).      

Although my PhD has been taking most of the time, I try to go for occasional runs/hikes and swims. Feel free to connect me on Strava <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/46282855"><i class="fab fa-strava fa-xl" title="Strava"></i></a> or hit me up if you would like to do any activity in Luxembourg. Also, I am always up for an online chess game.

### Music

My affair with music started with harmonium in childhood days. Multiple jamming sessions on old Marathi songs helped me improve my skills. Then I had a long break from music until I moved to Luxembourg. Social isloation in the foregin country brought me closer to music. I experience a great comfort in practising ukulele, piano and guitar. I can label myself as a self trained amature musician.


### Reading

This is something I want to take seriously in near future. -->

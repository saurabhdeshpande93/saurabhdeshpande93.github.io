# About




I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Team Legato](https://legato-team.eu) of the University of Luxembourg,
I am being supervised by [Prof. Stéphane Bordas](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QKZBZ48AAAAJ&hl=en).
My thesis is a part of  Marie Skłodawaska Curie Actions funded European training network, [ITN Rainbow](https://rainbow.ku.dk).
I am deeply interested in AI and its applications to scientific simulations and computer vision problems. As a part of my Ph.D., I am developing Bayesian and geometric deep learning frameworks to come up with scalable, accurate and trustworthy computing models, for their applications in computational mechanics (refer [<span style="color:blue">Publications</span>](/publications)). More recently I have also been working on deep-learning predictive models for medical imaging applications.
 <!-- accelerate computationally costly conventional numerical methods -->

Before this, I spent two wonderful years as a Scientist/Engineer at the Indian Space Research Organisation ([ISRO](https://www.isro.gov.in)).
I graduated with an integrated bachelor's and master's degree in mechanical engineering (specialisation in product design)
from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in 2017.

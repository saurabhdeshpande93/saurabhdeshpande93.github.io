# Songwriting

In my spare time I love to play different musical instruments and write/compose songs. So far I have written three songs of which two (Raaste and Proposal) are available on all major music streaming platforms. All of my songs are bedroom recorded, you can find them below:

I also cover songs and rarely post on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@saurabhdeshpande/featured" title="YouTube" class="no-mark-external" target="_blank"> <span class="icon-youtube"></span> <span aria-hidden="true">YouTube</span><span class="sr-only">Saurabh's YouTube channel</span></a> handle, and more frequently on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saurabh.deshpande.1238/" title="Instagram" class="no-mark-external" target="_blank"> <span class="icon-instagram"></span> <span aria-hidden="true">Instagram </span><span class="sr-only">Saurabh's instagram profile</span></a> feed.
